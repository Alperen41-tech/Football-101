# Football-101
A desktop application developed by me (Written in Java).
My purpose was to provide people with the opportunity to enjoy without spending too much time.
The application is composed of two player sticks which act as goalkeepers, a ball, and football
area. Two players try to prevent the ball from exiting the frame boundaries using those sticks.
When the ball exits the frame, the player's score increases one‑by‑one, and the first player who
reaches 10 points wins.
Requirements: Calculating ball and player stick coordinates simultaneously, Detecting goals and
game conclusion.
